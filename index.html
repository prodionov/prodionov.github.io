            <p> When exiting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile_End_tube_station"> Mile End station</a> turn left and walk around the corner, where you will find an excellent Portuguese cafe called <a href="http://coffeeespresso.webs.com/">coffee espresso</a>.
                There are no hipsters in-sight and you can quietly enjoy a cup of strong coffee with a sweet dessert or a fried breakfast. <br> The prices are low, the service is friendly and unobtrusive<br> The atmosphere is great and the place is often
                full of locals. Personally, I would recommend the classic combination of a double espresso with a Pastel de Nata (custard tart)</p>

            <p> Once you have finished your coffee, you can leisurely stroll northwards towards Victoria Park. The best way to do so is along the Regent canal, which is especially picturesque in summer. Some of the house boats moored along the canal have
                been turned into small coffee shops. Unfortunately, there is a limited number of coffees one can have per day, so perhaps have a tea or sneaky pint of beer instead. <br> Watch out for runners and cyclists though. The path is filled with
                them on a sunny day. Generally, they are a lovely bunch, but can quietly creep up behind you.<br> Finally, just before you hit the park, spend a few minutes at the open-air gym, which looks like a present from Adidas to the neighbourhood
                for the Olympic games. </p>

            <p>Victoria Park is an absolute gem and it is worth spending an entire day there. The park is huge and provides plenty of opportunities to play sports, have a picnic with friends or family, go on a long stroll, and simply disconnect from the
                city. The lakeside Pavilion caf√© does excellent brunches, sandwiches and snacks and there is a great farmers market on Sundays from 10am-3pm. </p>

            <p>After several hours outside in the park, why not to treat yourself to the best Northern Chinese restaurant in London. The place is extremely unpretentious, affordable and often buzzing with a young crowd.
                <br> If you decide to go there, make sure to try the chief's specials: homemade dumplings, chive pancakes and smacked cucumber salad, which all taste great with a bottle or two of Tiger beer.
