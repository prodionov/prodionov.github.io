            <p> On arrival to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile_End_tube_station"> Mile End station</a> turn left and walk around the corner, where you will find an excellent Portuguese cafe <a href="http://coffeeespresso.webs.com/">coffee espresso</a>. There are no hipster in-sight and you
                can quietly enjoy a cup of strong coffee with a sweet desert or a deep fried breakfast. <br> Prices are low, servie is friendly and unobtrusive<br> The atmosphere is great and the place is often full of locals. Personally, I would recommend
                a rather standard doubel espresson with a Pastel de Nata</p>

            <p> Once you are finished with your coffee, you can leisurely stroll North towards the Victoria park. The best way to do so is along the Regent canal. The place is especially picturesque in the summer. Some of the boat are turned into little coffee
                shops. Unfortunately, there is limited number of cups one can have per day. May be have a tea instead <br> Watch out for runners and cyclist though. The path is filled with them on a sunny day. Generally, they lovely bunch. <br> Finally,
                just before you hit the park, spend a few minutes at the open-air gym, which looks like a present from Adidas to the neighbourhood for the Olympic games</p>

            <p>Victoria Park is an absolute gem and it is worth spending an entire day there. The park is huge and provides plenty of opportunities to play sports, have a picnic with friends or family, go on a long stroll, and simply disconnect from the
                city. </p>

            <p>After several hours outside in the park, why not to treat yourself to the best Northern Chinese restaurant in London. The place is extremely unpretencious, affordable and often buzzing with a young crowd.
                <br> If you decide to get there, make sure to try the chief's special, homemade DUMPLINGs, spinach pancakes with a bottle or two of Tiger beer.
